    "content": "That's a great idea for your Test Todo App! Adding user authentication will definitely enhance its capabilities. To help me break this down into specific tasks and ensure we build exactly what you need, I have a few clarifying questions:\n\n*   **What specific authentication features do you need?** Beyond just logging in, should users be able to register new accounts (sign-up), recover forgotten passwords, or manage their own profile information?\n*   **How do you envision the user interface for authentication?** For example, will there be a dedicated login/signup page, or perhaps a pop-up modal within the existing application?\n*   **How should the existing todo items behave with user authentication?** Should each user have their *own* private list of todos, or will it be a shared list that authenticated users can contribute to?\n*   **Are there any specific authentication methods you prefer?** For instance, traditional username/password, or are you considering social logins (like Google/GitHub) or token-based authentication (like JWTs, which are common with FastAPI)?\n\nOnce I understand these details, I can create a perfect implementation plan for you!",
