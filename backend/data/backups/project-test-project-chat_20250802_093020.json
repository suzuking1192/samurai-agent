    "content": "That's a great idea for your project! Adding user authentication will definitely enhance its capabilities. To help me break this down into specific tasks and ensure we build exactly what you need, I have a few clarifying questions:\n\n*   **Specific Functionality:** What authentication features do you envision? Beyond just a basic login, will users need to register for accounts, recover forgotten passwords, or should there be different user roles (e.g., admin vs. regular user) with varying permissions for todo items?\n*   **User Interface/Experience:** Given this is primarily a \"Test Todo App for CLI testing,\" how do you expect users to authenticate? Will there be a web-based login form built with React, or will authentication be handled entirely through CLI commands (e.g., `todo login <username> <password>`) that interact with the FastAPI backend?\n*   **Integration with Todos:** How should user authentication integrate with the existing todo features? For example, should each user have their own *private* list of todos that only they can see and manage, or will todos be shared among users with access controlled by their authentication status or roles?\n\nOnce I understand these details, I can create a perfect implementation plan for you!",

    "content": "I need complete user authentication with email/password. Users should be able to register new accounts, login, logout, and reset forgotten passwords. Each user should have their own private todo list - no sharing between users. Use JWT tokens for authentication with the FastAPI backend. For the frontend, create separate dedicated pages for login and registration with proper form validation. Store JWT tokens securely and add middleware to protect routes that require authentication.",
