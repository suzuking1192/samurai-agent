# Samurai Agent Task Creation Protocol Implementation Summary

## Problem Solved

The previous system was genericizing user requests and creating tasks with placeholder titles like "New Task" instead of using the user's exact wording and intent.

## Solution Implemented: Samurai Agent Protocol

### âœ… **Core Behavior for Task Creation**

When a user requests to create a new task or add something as a task:

1. **Extract the EXACT content** they want as the task
2. **Use their words** as the task title/description, don't genericize it
3. **Confirm what you understood** before creating

### âœ… **Key Changes Made**

#### 1. **Exact User Wording Extraction** (`tool_calling_agent.py`)
- Added `_extract_task_content_from_message()` method
- Uses regex patterns to extract exact content from user requests
- Preserves original case and technical terminology
- Handles various request formats:
  - "Create a task for delete generate prompt button"
  - "Add delete generate prompt button as a task"
  - "Make this a task" (context reference)

#### 2. **Enhanced Planning Prompts**
Updated planning prompts to follow Samurai Agent protocol:
```
SAMURAI AGENT TASK CREATION PROTOCOL:
- Extract the EXACT content the user wants as the task
- Use their words as the task title/description, don't genericize it
- Confirm what you understood before creating
- Preserve technical terminology and exact wording
```

#### 3. **Improved Task Suggestions**
- Modified `_provide_task_suggestions()` to show exact user wording
- Single tasks with exact wording get special formatting:
  ```
  I can create a task with your exact wording:
  **Task Title:** "delete generate prompt button"
  **Just to confirm, you want me to create a task titled 'delete generate prompt button' - is that right?**
  ```

#### 4. **Samurai Agent Confirmation Format**
Updated task creation confirmation to follow the protocol:
```
Perfect! I've created a new task:
Title: "delete generate prompt button"
Status: âœ… Created!
```

#### 5. **Context-Aware Task Creation**
- Detects when users say "add this as a task" and references previous context
- Preserves technical terminology (e.g., "delete generate prompt button" not "remove button")
- Asks for clarification when context is unclear

## Expected User Experience

### Before (Generic):
```
User: "Create a task for delete generate prompt button"
Agent: âœ… Created a new task:
Title: "New Task"
Description: "Task created from user request"
```

### After (Samurai Agent Protocol):
```
User: "Create a task for delete generate prompt button"
Agent: 
I can create a task with your exact wording:
**Task Title:** "delete generate prompt button"
**Just to confirm, you want me to create a task titled 'delete generate prompt button' - is that right?**
ðŸ’¡ *Reply with 'yes' to create it, or ask me to modify it first.*

User: "yes"
Agent: Perfect! I've created a new task:
Title: "delete generate prompt button"
Status: âœ… Created!
```

## Test Results

Created and ran comprehensive tests that verified:

âœ… **Exact Wording Extraction**: Correctly extracts user's exact wording from various request formats  
âœ… **Task Suggestions**: Uses exact user wording in suggestions  
âœ… **Confirmation Format**: Follows Samurai Agent confirmation format  
âœ… **Full Flow**: Complete task creation flow works with exact wording  

### Test Scenarios Covered:
1. **Pattern Extraction**: "Create a task for X" â†’ extracts "X"
2. **Pattern Extraction**: "Add X as a task" â†’ extracts "X"
3. **Context Reference**: "Make this a task" â†’ handles context reference
4. **Confirmation Format**: Verifies Samurai Agent confirmation format
5. **Full Flow**: End-to-end task creation with exact wording

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Precision**: Uses user's exact wording instead of generic placeholders
2. **Context Preservation**: Maintains technical terminology and intent
3. **User Control**: Confirms exact understanding before creating
4. **Better UX**: Clear, specific task titles that match user intent
5. **Professional Feel**: Follows established Samurai Agent protocol
6. **Reduced Confusion**: No disconnect between user request and created task

## Files Modified

1. **`backend/services/tool_calling_agent.py`**
   - Added exact wording extraction methods
   - Updated planning prompts for Samurai Agent protocol
   - Enhanced fallback plans with exact wording
   - Updated confirmation format

2. **`backend/services/agent_planning.py`**
   - Updated task suggestion method for exact wording
   - Enhanced task creation confirmation format
   - Improved single vs multiple task handling

## Technical Implementation Details

### Exact Wording Extraction
```python
def _extract_task_content_from_message(self, user_message: str) -> str:
    # Common patterns for task creation requests
    patterns = [
        r"create a task for (.+)",
        r"add (.+) as a task",
        r"make this a task"
    ]
    # Extract and preserve original case
```

### Task Suggestion with Exact Wording
```python
async def _provide_task_suggestions(self, plan: Dict[str, Any]) -> str:
    # Check if single task with exact user wording
    # Show special format for exact wording tasks
    # Use confirmation with exact wording
```

### Samurai Agent Confirmation Format
```python
def _generate_task_creation_confirmation(self, tool_results: List[Dict[str, Any]]) -> str:
    # Format: "Perfect! I've created a new task:"
    # Show: "Title: \"exact wording\""
    # End: "Status: âœ… Created!"
```

## Usage

Users can now:
1. **Request tasks with exact wording**: "Create a task for delete generate prompt button"
2. **See their exact wording confirmed**: "Just to confirm, you want me to create a task titled 'delete generate prompt button' - is that right?"
3. **Get precise task titles**: Tasks are created with their exact wording
4. **Maintain technical terminology**: "delete generate prompt button" not "remove button"
5. **Reference context**: "Add this as a task" works with previous conversation

The system now follows the Samurai Agent protocol, providing precise, context-aware task creation that respects the user's exact wording and intent.
