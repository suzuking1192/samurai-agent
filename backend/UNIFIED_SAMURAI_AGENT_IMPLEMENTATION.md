# Unified Samurai Agent Implementation with Smart Memory Management

## Overview

The Unified Samurai Agent is a comprehensive AI agent that combines the best features of both the original SamuraiAgent and PlanningFirstAgent with intelligent memory management. It provides a single, efficient architecture that handles all conversation types while only updating memories at session boundaries or explicit user requests.

## Key Features

### 1. Unified Architecture
- **Single Agent**: Combines planning-first architecture with context loading and vector similarity
- **Smart Intent Analysis**: Sophisticated intent classification with 5 distinct categories
- **Context-Aware Processing**: Uses conversation history and vector-enhanced context
- **Tool Integration**: Seamless integration with existing tool registry and services

### 2. Smart Memory Management
- **Session-Based Updates**: Memories only created when sessions end
- **Explicit Requests**: Immediate memory updates for explicit user requests
- **Quality Filtering**: Only substantial information is stored as memories
- **Consolidated Storage**: Uses existing consolidated memory service

### 3. Intent Analysis System
The agent classifies user intent into 5 categories:

1. **pure_discussion** - Questions, explanations, general chat
2. **feature_exploration** - User thinking about features, needs clarification
3. **spec_clarification** - User providing details in response to questions
4. **ready_for_action** - Complete specifications, ready for task creation
5. **direct_action** - Immediate action requests (task completion, deletion)

## Architecture

### Core Components

#### UnifiedSamuraiAgent Class
```python
class UnifiedSamuraiAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.gemini_service = GeminiService()
        self.file_service = FileService()
        self.tool_registry = AgentToolRegistry()
        self.consolidated_memory_service = ConsolidatedMemoryService()
```

#### Data Structures
```python
@dataclass
class IntentAnalysis:
    intent_type: str
    confidence: float
    reasoning: str
    needs_clarification: bool
    clarification_questions: List[str]
    accumulated_specs: Dict[str, Any]

@dataclass
class ConversationContext:
    session_messages: List[ChatMessage]
    conversation_summary: str
    relevant_tasks: List[Task]
    relevant_memories: List[Memory]
    project_context: dict
    vector_embedding: Optional[List[float]] = None
```

### Processing Flow

1. **Context Loading**: Load conversation history and vector-enhanced context
2. **Intent Analysis**: Analyze user intent with conversation context
3. **Response Path Selection**: Choose appropriate processing path
4. **Execution**: Execute tools or generate responses
5. **Memory Management**: Handle explicit memory requests if present

## API Integration

### Updated Endpoints

#### Main Chat Endpoint
```python
@app.post("/projects/{project_id}/chat", response_model=ChatResponse)
async def chat_with_project(project_id: str, request: ChatRequest):
    # Uses unified_samurai_agent.process_message()
```

#### Progress Streaming Endpoint
```python
@app.post("/projects/{project_id}/chat-with-progress")
async def chat_with_progress(project_id: str, request: ChatRequest):
    # Uses unified_samurai_agent.process_message() with progress_callback
```

#### Session Completion Endpoint
```python
@app.post("/projects/{project_id}/sessions/{session_id}/complete")
async def complete_session(project_id: str, session_id: str):
    # Uses unified_samurai_agent.complete_session()
```

## Memory Management

### Session-Based Memory Creation
Memories are only created when a session ends (user clicks "start new conversation"):

```python
async def complete_session(self, session_id: str, project_id: str, project_context: dict) -> dict:
    # 1. Get all session messages
    # 2. Perform session-wide analysis
    # 3. Extract high-importance insights
    # 4. Create consolidated memories
```

### Explicit Memory Requests
Immediate memory updates for explicit user requests:

```python
def _is_explicit_memory_request(self, message: str) -> bool:
    triggers = [
        "remember this", "save this", "update memory", "don't forget", 
        "store this decision", "keep this in mind", "note this"
    ]
```

### Memory Quality Filters
- Only insights with importance_score > 0.7 are stored
- Substantial technical decisions and specifications
- User preferences and architectural choices
- Implementation patterns and approaches

## Intent Analysis

### LLM-Based Analysis
Uses Gemini service for sophisticated intent understanding:

```python
async def _analyze_user_intent(self, message: str, context: ConversationContext) -> IntentAnalysis:
    # Build context-aware prompt
    # Use LLM for intent classification
    # Fallback to keyword-based detection
```

### Fallback Detection
Robust keyword-based detection when LLM fails:

```python
# Feature exploration keywords
exploration_keywords = ["thinking about", "maybe", "considering", "wondering"]

# Ready for action keywords  
action_keywords = ["create tasks", "add", "implement", "build"]

# Direct action keywords
direct_keywords = ["mark", "delete", "complete", "finish"]
```

## Response Paths

### 1. Pure Discussion Path
- No tool calling
- Context-aware responses
- Uses conversation history and project knowledge

### 2. Feature Exploration Path
- Generates clarifying questions
- Acknowledges user ideas
- Gathers complete specifications

### 3. Specification Clarification Path
- Acknowledges provided details
- Checks if enough information gathered
- Offers to create tasks when ready

### 4. Ready for Action Path
- Generates task breakdown
- Executes task creation tools
- Provides comprehensive response

### 5. Direct Action Path
- Executes immediate actions
- Task completion/deletion
- Status updates

## Context Management

### Vector-Enhanced Context
Uses existing vector context service:

```python
async def _build_vector_enhanced_context(self, message: str, project_id: str, 
                                       session_messages: List[ChatMessage], 
                                       project_context: dict) -> dict:
    # Generate conversation embedding
    # Find relevant tasks and memories
    # Assemble comprehensive context
```

### Conversation Summary
Creates concise conversation summaries:

```python
def _create_conversation_summary(self, session_messages: List[ChatMessage], 
                               current_message: str) -> str:
    # Get last 5 messages
    # Format for context inclusion
    # Include current message
```
