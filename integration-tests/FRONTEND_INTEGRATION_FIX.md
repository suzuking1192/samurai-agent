# Frontend Integration Fix - Unified Samurai Agent

## 🐛 **Issue Identified**

The frontend was still calling the **planning first agent** instead of the new **unified samurai agent** for streaming chat functionality.

## 🔍 **Root Cause**

The `/projects/{project_id}/chat-stream` endpoint in `backend/main.py` was still using the old `planning_first_agent` instead of the new `unified_samurai_agent`.

### **Problematic Code:**
```python
# 4. Process with agent
from services.planning_first_agent import planning_first_agent

# Start processing
processing_task = asyncio.create_task(
    planning_first_agent.process_user_message(  # ❌ Old agent
        message=request.message,
        project_id=project_id,
        project_context=project_context,
        session_id=current_session.id,
        conversation_history=conversation_history,
        progress_callback=progress_callback
    )
)
```

## ✅ **Fix Applied**

Updated the `chat-stream` endpoint to use the unified samurai agent:

### **Fixed Code:**
```python
# 4. Process with unified agent
# Start processing
processing_task = asyncio.create_task(
    unified_samurai_agent.process_message(  # ✅ New unified agent
        message=request.message,
        project_id=project_id,
        project_context=project_context,
        session_id=current_session.id,
        conversation_history=conversation_history,
        progress_callback=progress_callback
    )
)
```

## 🧪 **Verification Results**

### **Before Fix:**
- Frontend was using planning first agent
- No intent analysis in responses
- Missing unified agent features

### **After Fix:**
- ✅ Frontend now uses unified samurai agent
- ✅ Intent analysis working correctly
- ✅ All unified agent features available
- ✅ Smart memory management operational
