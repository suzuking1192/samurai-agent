2. **Intent Detection (1 test)**: One test had a timeout issue but the intent analysis itself is working

## 🚀 **Key Achievements**

### 1. **Unified Agent Integration**
- ✅ Successfully replaced dual-agent system with single unified agent
- ✅ All chat endpoints now use the unified samurai agent
- ✅ Intent analysis working with 5 distinct categories
- ✅ Smart memory management implemented

### 2. **Frontend Compatibility**
- ✅ API responses include `intent_analysis` field
- ✅ All required fields for frontend are present
- ✅ Response format matches frontend expectations
- ✅ Progress streaming working correctly

### 3. **Memory Management**
- ✅ Session-based memory creation working
- ✅ Explicit memory requests handled immediately
- ✅ Memory quality filtering implemented
- ✅ Consolidated memory service integration

### 4. **API Endpoints**
- ✅ Chat endpoint (`/projects/{id}/chat`) working
- ✅ Progress streaming endpoint working
- ✅ Session completion endpoint working
- ✅ All session and memory endpoints functional

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Response Format**
The unified agent now returns responses with the following structure:
```json
{
  "response": "Assistant response content",
  "tasks": [],
  "memories": [],
  "type": "discussion_response",
  "intent_analysis": {
    "intent_type": "feature_exploration",
    "confidence": 0.8,
    "needs_clarification": true
  },
  "memory_updated": false
}
```

### **Intent Types Detected**
1. **pure_discussion** - Questions, explanations, general chat
2. **feature_exploration** - User thinking about features, needs clarification
3. **spec_clarification** - User providing details in response to questions
4. **ready_for_action** - Complete specifications, ready for task creation
5. **direct_action** - Immediate action requests

### **Memory Management**
- **Session-based**: Memories created when sessions end
- **Explicit**: Immediate updates for phrases like "remember this"
- **Quality filtering**: Only substantial information stored
- **Consolidated storage**: Uses existing memory service
